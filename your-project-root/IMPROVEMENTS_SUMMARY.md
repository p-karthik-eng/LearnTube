## üéØ **Expected Results**

### **Before Improvements**
```json
{
  "content": {
    "introduction": "In this lesson, we'll explore inheritance.",
    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "Understanding Inheritance",
        "points": [
          {
            "subtitle": "What is inheritance?",
            "content": "Inheritance allows classes to inherit from parent classes."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "quizzes": [
    {
      "question": "What is inheritance?",
      "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "answer": "Correct answer will be determined"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **After Improvements**
```json
{
  "content": {
    "introduction": "In this lesson, we'll explore inheritance in object-oriented programming and how it enables code reuse and establishes relationships between classes.",
    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "Understanding Inheritance",
        "points": [
          {
            "subtitle": "What is inheritance?",
            "content": "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class. This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes. For example, if you have a Vehicle class, you can create a Car class that inherits all the properties of Vehicle while adding its own specific features."
          },
          {
            "subtitle": "Benefits of inheritance",
            "content": "Inheritance provides several key benefits: code reuse reduces duplication, polymorphism allows different classes to be treated uniformly, and it creates a clear hierarchy that makes code more organized and maintainable."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "quizzes": [
    {
      "question": "What is the primary benefit of inheritance in object-oriented programming?",
      "options": [
        "It makes code run faster",
        "It allows code reuse and reduces duplication",
        "It improves syntax highlighting",
        "It reduces file size"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "answer": "It allows code reuse and reduces duplication",
      "explanation": "Inheritance allows you to create a new class that inherits all the attributes and methods from an existing class, eliminating the need to rewrite code and promoting better organization."
    }
  ]
}
```

## üöÄ **How to Test**

1. **Run the improved test**:
