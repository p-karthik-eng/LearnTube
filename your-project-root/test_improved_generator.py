    Welcome to this comprehensive Python programming tutorial. In this video, we'll cover object-oriented programming in Python.
    
    Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects to design applications and computer programs.
    In Python, everything is an object. When you create a variable, you're actually creating an instance of a class.
    
    Let's start with classes. A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that the objects will have.
    For example, if you want to create a Car class, you would define what properties a car has, like color, brand, and model.
    
    Methods are functions that belong to a class. They define the behavior of the objects. For instance, a Car class might have methods like start_engine(), stop_engine(), and drive().
    
    Inheritance is another important concept. It allows you to create a new class that inherits attributes and methods from an existing class.
    This promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes. For example, you could create an ElectricCar class that inherits from the Car class.
    
    Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This means you can use the same method name for different classes.
    For example, both Car and ElectricCar might have a drive() method, but they implement it differently.
    
    Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit or object.
    It helps to hide the internal state of an object and only expose the necessary parts through a public interface.
    
    Let's look at a practical example. We'll create a simple class hierarchy for different types of vehicles.
