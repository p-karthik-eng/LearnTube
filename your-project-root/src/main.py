    Welcome to this comprehensive Python programming course. In this tutorial, we'll start with the basics of Python programming. 
    Python is a high-level programming language that was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. 
    Python is known for its simplicity and readability. Let's begin with variables. In Python, you can create variables by 
    simply assigning a value to them. For example, name equals John, age equals 25. Python supports several data types 
    including integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Integers are whole numbers like 1, 2, 3. Floats are decimal numbers 
    like 3.14, 2.5. Strings are text enclosed in quotes like Hello World. Booleans are True or False values. 
    Now let's talk about conditional statements. If statements allow you to execute code based on certain conditions. 
    For example, if age is greater than 18, print adult, else print minor. Loops are used to repeat code. 
    The for loop iterates over a sequence, while the while loop continues as long as a condition is true. 
    Functions are reusable blocks of code. You define a function using the def keyword followed by the function name and parameters.
